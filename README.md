# CryptoClustering

**Description:**

For this challenge, Python and unsupervised learning methods were used to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

**Steps:**
1. Preparing the Data:
   
    A. Used the StandardScaler() module tol normalize the data from the CSV file.
   
    B. Created a DataFrame with the scaled data and set the coin_id as the index for the new DataFrame

3. Finding the Best Value for k Using the Original Scaled DataFrame, Using the Elbow Method:
   
    A. Created a list with the number of k values from 1 to 11
   
    B. Created an empty list to store the inertia values
   
    C. Created a `for` loop to compute the inertia with each possible value of k
   
    D. Created a dictionary with the data to plot the elbow curve
   
    E. Plotted a line chart with all the inertia values computed with the different k values to visually identify the optimal value for k

5. Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Scaled Data:
   
    A. Initialized the K-means model with the best value for k
   
    B. Fit the K-means model using the original scaled DataFrame
   
    C. Predicted the clusters to group the cryptocurrencies using the original scaled DataFrame
   
    D. Created a copy of the original data to add the new column with the predicted clusters
   
    E. Created a scatter plot using hvPlot with the following parameters:
        x-axis = PC1
        y-axis = PC2

7. Optimized Clusters with PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
   
    A. Performed a PCA on the original DataFrame to reduce the features to 3 principal components
   
    B. Retrieved the explained variance to determine
   
    C. Created a new DataFrame with the PCA data

9. Find the Best Value for K Using the PCA Data, Using the elbow method
    
    A. Created a list with the number of k values from 1 to 11
   
    B. Created an empty list to store the inertia values
   
    C. Created a `for` loop to compute the inertia with each possible value of k
   
    D. Created a dictionary with the data to plot the elbow curve
   
    E. Plotted a line chart with all the inertia values computed with the different k values to visually identify the optimal value for k

11. Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data
    
    A. Initialized the K-means model with the best value for k
    
    B. Fit the K-means model using the PCA data
    
    C. Predicted the clusters to group the cryptocurrencies using the PCA data
    
    D. Created a copy of the PCA DataFrame to add the new column with the predicted clusters
    
    E. Created a scatter plot using hvPlot with the following parameters:
    
        x-axis = price_change_percentage_24h
    
        y-axis = price_change_percentage_7d
